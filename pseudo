1) Make a class for foliations:
    * This will have N full meshes in it
    * Have to specify the path and file names appropriately
        o Go back and make sure the script for equivolume surfaces outputs integers

2) Make a plotting class:
    * The requirements for plotting will change as the code progresses
    * Need something that can plot scalars and vectors on meshses
    * Need something that will make plots of scalars versus deep/superficial coordinate
