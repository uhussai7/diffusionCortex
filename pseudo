1) Make a class for foliations:
    *[D] This will have N full meshes in it
    *[D] Have to specify the path and file names appropriately
        o[D] Go back and make sure the script for equivolume surfaces outputs integers
            * Had to modify their code for this
    * Projecting on each surface of foliation takes a long time because the Projection class makes an interpolator for
      each surface in the foliation
        o The fix is to make a volume class that has a function makeInterpolator and integer InterpolatorDone that can
          then be used by projection class and other function

2) Make a plotting class:
    * The requirements for plotting will change as the code progresses
    * Need something that can plot scalars and vectors on meshses
    * Need something that will make plots of scalars versus deep/superficial coordinate
